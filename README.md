# Wasserstein-Emp-Bound

Notes on the folders:
- paths1 and paths2 are the two systems of $E=12J, 120J$ run on my computer
- AVMs is obsolete and incomplete; it used the built-in scipy wasserstein function (generated using: `WassDistr.ipynb`)
- AVMs2 is what we use as the most regular AVMs of the original data (generated using: `WassDistr2.ipynb`)
- AVMs3 is the AVMs from the server simulations
- AVMs4 is the AVMs computed based on every b-th observation (generated using: `WassDistr4.ipynb`)
- AVMs4a is obsolete and incomplete; it used the built-in scipy wasserstein function (generated using: `WassDistr4.ipynb` too)
- AVMs4b contains the correct AVMs calculated on every $b$-th element in the sequence (generated using: `WassDistr4.ipynb` too)
- UAVMs is the AVMs of the PIT-transformed data from our own simulations (generated using: `UPooledWassDistr.ipynb`)
